## 2026-07-31 — kickoff and requirements freeze

- Confirmed the exact event as Arm Create: AI Optimization Challenge 2026.
- Verified the official overview, rules, track detail, schedule, resources, and
  Arm Create pages.
- Created the local repository and configured the requested GitHub origin.
- Selected Apache-2.0, one of the two licenses explicitly accepted by the event.
- Recorded the six named optimization fronts, three published tracks, judging
  weights, mandatory artifacts, and conflicting official language.
- Deferred project selection until hardware/toolchain feasibility and repository
  research are complete.

### Interesting early finding

The highest-scoring strategy is not simply the fastest model. Technical
implementation is 40%, but impact, DX, and WOW total 60%. A reusable optimization
ladder with rigorous proof and a sharply visual demo can score across all four
criteria while still concentrating on one coherent workload and one track.

## 2026-07-31 — environment, ecosystem, and strategy checkpoint

- Audited the current x86_64 host. It is suitable for orchestration, tests,
  AArch64 cross-code generation, and LLVM-MCA modeling, but too noisy and not Arm
  hardware, so it cannot support final performance claims.
- Confirmed free native Linux Arm64 and Apple Silicon runners for the public
  GitHub repository. The organizer separately confirmed Apple Silicon counts for
  Mobile AI.
- Found the official late guidance that running on Arm alone is insufficient;
  the project must expose baseline, technical changes, measured benefit, and
  reusable artifacts.
- Found no challenge-owned starter repository. Arm LLM-Runner is the best
  sponsor-maintained substrate: a common API across four runtimes, explicit
  KleidiAI ablations, Linux/Android support, benchmarks, and Streamline markers.
- Surveyed the public competitor space. Standalone llama.cpp tuners, KleidiAI
  benchmark wrappers, and dashboards are already crowded.
- Identified a workload-aware, quality-constrained, cross-runtime planner as the
  leading single-project hypothesis. It remains gated on native feasibility and
  a source-level or search-method novelty contribution.
- Defined ordered experiments E0–E7 before beginning benchmark work.

### Breakthrough

The development workflow and product can be the same thing: an automated system
that repeatedly profiles, breaks, tunes, validates, and records a real Arm AI
workload. The experiment history becomes both engineering evidence and the live
demo of the reusable optimization tool. The Arm LLM-Runner abstraction makes the
comparison cross-runtime rather than another one-off llama.cpp tuner.
