# Pareto64 submission package

This directory converts the repository's native Arm evidence into the fields
and media needed for the Arm Create: AI Optimization Challenge 2026 entry.

- [`devpost.md`](devpost.md): paste-ready English project description.
- [`evidence.md`](evidence.md): compact claim-to-run index with immutable hashes.
- [`demo-script.md`](demo-script.md): public video script under three minutes.
- [`compliance.md`](compliance.md): final technical and account checklist.

The interactive static demo is in [`../demo/index.html`](../demo/index.html).
From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4174 --directory demo
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:4174>. Run the complete no-dependency package check
with:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_submission.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The repository does not publish or configure a hosted site automatically.
Before final submission, the entrant must put the static `demo/` directory at a
public URL that remains available through September 4, 2026, upload the video,
and replace the URL placeholders in `devpost.md` and `compliance.md`.
